# üß† Prompt Intelligence Graph - Knowledge Network

## Overview

The Prompt Intelligence Graph creates a **semantic web of interconnected prompts** similar to what Notion did for documents or GitHub for code. It's a knowledge network that understands relationships between ideas and automatically maps them.

## üéØ Core Concept

Every prompt, topic, and output is stored and linked intelligently. The system uses AI to understand relationships like:
- `marketing prompt` ‚Üí `copywriting prompt` ‚Üí `landing page prompt`
- `SEO content` ‚Üí `blog writing` ‚Üí `social media posts`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

#### 1. **prompt_nodes** - The Core Graph Nodes
Every prompt becomes a node in the knowledge graph with:
- Prompt text and metadata
- Category & platform context
- Keywords for semantic search
- Timestamp for trend analysis

#### 2. **prompt_relationships** - The Connections
AI-detected relationships between prompts:
- **derived_from**: One prompt builds upon another
- **similar_to**: Prompts share core concepts
- **inspired_by**: Influence relationships
- **prerequisite_for**: Sequential dependencies
- **alternative_to**: Different approaches to same goal

Each relationship has:
- Strength score (0-1)
- AI confidence level
- Reasoning metadata

#### 3. **prompt_topics** - Semantic Clustering
AI-extracted topics that group related prompts:
- Topic name and description
- Hierarchical structure (parent-child)
- Prompt count for popularity

#### 4. **prompt_topic_links** - Many-to-Many Mapping
Links prompts to multiple topics with relevance scores

#### 5. **prompt_network_insights** - AI-Powered Analytics
System generates actionable insights:
- **Clusters**: Groups of related prompts
- **Trends**: Emerging patterns
- **Patterns**: Recurring structures
- **Opportunities**: Gaps in coverage

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis

### Edge Function: `analyze-prompt-relationships`

When a new prompt is created, the system:

1. **Fetches Context**: Retrieves last 50 prompts from user's graph
2. **AI Analysis**: Sends to Gemini 2.5 Flash for semantic analysis
3. **Relationship Detection**: AI identifies connections with reasoning
4. **Topic Extraction**: Extracts 5-10 key concepts/themes
5. **Network Insights**: Generates strategic recommendations
6. **Graph Storage**: Stores nodes, edges, topics, and insights

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses a sophisticated prompt that asks AI to:
- Analyze semantic relationships
- Identify direct connections with confidence scores
- Extract topics with relevance scores
- Generate network insights with actionable suggestions

- Community insights

## üìà Analytics & Insights

The system tracks:
- Network size (nodes, connections, topics)
- Growth trends
- Most connected prompts
- Popular topics
- Insight confidence scores
- Relationship type distribution

## üéØ Use Cases

1. **Content Strategy**: Map content pillars and themes
2. **Marketing Campaigns**: Track campaign evolution
3. **Product Development**: Connect feature ideas
4. **Learning Paths**: Build progressive prompt sequences
5. **Team Collaboration**: Share knowledge networks

## üîÆ Future Vision

This creates a **Notion-like network effect** for prompts:
- The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes
- Builds an irreplaceable knowledge asset
- Network insights improve with scale
- Community graphs for best practices
- Marketplace for prompt networks

**This is what separates a simple prompt tool from a knowledge platform.**
It's not just about individual prompts‚Äîit's about the **relationships, patterns, and insights** that emerge from the network.
